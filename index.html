      <b>On 28 March 2024</b> that was the first time I saw you and I wanted to know. I know it’s weird to remember something like this randomly.
       I won’t be long now, you are busy dealing with work and school side by side.
        I was planning to write lovey dovey only I know how much you like happiness 
        but I also want to touch topics that are somewhat uncomfortable.
    </p>


    <p> She doesn’t like it when I look at her, she says “it’s rude to look at people that much” 
        while I tell her that “I think it is a compliment”, well maybe she’s right.
         She likes cars and she has so much knowledge about them she would talk about them for hours,
          on how they work, how to do something when you have a problem with a car.
           she talked about driving a car uphill, that sometimes she has a hard time keeping a car in motion,
            her worse fear is uma imoto izogcima while esakhuphuka intaba. 
        I like her when she geeks out about something she likes.</p>



        <p>
           One day we went out to watch a movie the problem came when we needed to go home, there were no immediate transports for us. 
           That night she really helped me save money by calling a Taxi rank manager (sorry ngikhohlwe igama lakhe)
            to pick us up. She will do signs of calming down, basically letting me know to calm and relax.  
        </p>

        <p>
            She’s amazing, Beautiful, cool, kind, wonderful, and smart. 
            I hope she knows that. Hey why is it, that whenever we have a serious conversation we dance around 
            it we will talk about it for seconds and something will disturb us and the topic will change either me or you, 
            it’s like we are scared to know each other that much or maybe it’s me.</p><p> She’s open to me about her life and I really love that.
             You once told me that your friends say “you are hyper and more energetic” and you seemed kind of ashamed about what they said,
              I like the little dances you make, the out of the blue songs that you sing. 
            I like that about you. You know some fashions that seem weird just like that top which looked like a skit.
        </p>

        She usually says “U-Sharp, u-right? “Uma ekubuza impilo, this is one of her favorite songs.
